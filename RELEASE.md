# Release process

## Release checklist

Before releasing anything, make sure that:

- [ ] Everything works as expected on all platforms
- [ ] The manual has been updated
- [ ] The CHANGELOG has been updated
- [ ] Theme files have been updated (if needed)
- [ ] Example maps have been updated (if needed)
- [ ] All commits have been pushed up to the repo


## Windows specific requirements

Use the 64-bit Nim compiler and install the 32 and 64-bit MinGW compiler
dependencies from the [official Nim downloads
page](https://nim-lang.org/install_windows.html). Adjust the value of
`mingW32Dir` in `config.nims` so it points to your MinGW32 installation.

The installer executable is generated by [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io)
(Nullsoft Scriptable Install System). Install NSIS first, then make sure
`makensis.exe` is available on the path.

The documentation related tasks must be executed under WSL on Windows.
