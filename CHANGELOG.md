## v1.2.0 – 2024-08-24

### New features

- A new [notes list pane](TODO) to view all notes in one place and filter
  them by various criteria, including full-text search.
- Up to four user-defined [window layouts](TODO).
- Scalable & high-DPI aware user interface.
- Proper multi-monitor support.
- Options to display [link lines](TODO) between linked cells.
- Option to [nudge levels](https://gridmonger.johnnovak.net/manual/advanced-editing.html#nudge-level)
  and move or paste [selections](https://gridmonger.johnnovak.net/manual/advanced-editing.html#selections)
  with wraparound.
- Support for [diagonal movement](https://gridmonger.johnnovak.net/manual/moving-around.html#diagonal-movement)
  via the numeric keypad or the YUBN keys (à la Rogue).
- [Open-ended excavate](https://gridmonger.johnnovak.net/manual/basic-editing.html#open-ended-excavate)
  option to aid in exploring tunnel-style dungeons.
- Option to pre-fill new levels with empty floors (for wall style maps).
- New [Arrow floor type](TODO) to represent moving floors and conveyor belts.
- Option to select whether the Left/Right cursor keys perform strafing or
  turning in [Walk Mode](https://gridmonger.johnnovak.net/manual/moving-around.html#walk-mode).
- Support for panning the level with the mouse (middle-click + drag, or
  Ctrl + left-click + drag). Works in *Paste Preview Mode* and *WASD Mode*, too.
- The selection can now be moved with the mouse in *Paste Preview Mode*.
- The [user manual](https://gridmonger.johnnovak.net/manual/contents.html) is
  now searchable (works in the offline documentation, too, but only page
  titles are displayed in the search results).
- Load map files by dragging & dropping their icons onto the program window or
  the taskbar icon.
- Check for updates on startup (can be disabled).
- macOS: The Command & Command+Shift modifiers are used for the keyboard
  shorcuts by default.
- macOS: Preferences setting to change the default Command & Command+Shift
  keyboard shortcut modifiers to Command & Command+Alt.
- macOS: Opening map files from the Finder now works.

### Enhancements

- The erase and clear floor actions don't erase labels now.
- Clear floor actions don't erase annotations now.
- Setting the cursor position with the mouse has been improved; the cursor
  follows the mouse pointer when you move it outside the level's bounds.
- Turn off *Trail Mode* automatically in more scenarios that result in
  confusing or unwanted behaviour.
- The orientation of non-oriented floor types can no longer be changed.
- Restoring the window size and position at startup is now more robust and
  handles multi-monitor scenarios better.
- Increase the zoom range from 1–20 to 1–50.
- Idle performance has been improved; CPU and GPU utilisation is now close to
  zero when there is no user input.
- All sorted items now use [natural sort order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order).
- Maps are now saved to a temporary file first and then renamed to minimise
  the chance of data corruption.
- The user manual has been overhauled for improved wording and clarity.
- Improved status bar messages, dialogs, and more status icons.
- Theme improvements and updates.
- Ctrl+Shift+Z can now also be use for "redo".
- Auto-increment elevation from `G` to `-1` in the new level dialog

### Fixes

- Fix crash when undoing the creation of the first level in an empty map.
- Fix crash when deleting the last remaining level of a map.
- Fix crash when nudging large levels zooomed in close to the maximum zoom
  factor.
- Fix nudging non-square levels; previously, the maximum vertical nudge amount
  was erroneously capped to the level's number of columns (instead of number
  of rows).
- Fix moving selections not moving links correctly (or at all).
- Fix moving selections leaving copies of the original labels if they were on
  empty cells.
- Fix evil link corruption bug. Moving cells that contain
  links, then either cancelling the move operation or performing it and then
  undoing the move could generate extra "invisible links" that are invalid.
  Saving the map would still succeed but would result in a corrupted map
  file that you could not load back in the previous version.
- Such corrupted map files are now fixed on load (by removing invalid
  links) and a warning is displayed.
- Canceling the *Save As* dialog invoked during the quit process no longer
  exits and discards the map without saving.
- If autosaving is enabled, the map no longer gets immediately autosaved
  right after adding the first level to an empty map.
- The autosave timer now resets when the autosave preference is enabled.
- Autosaved untitled maps that have never been manually saved are now
  auto-numbered and restored if the *Load last map* preference is enabled.
- The notes pane now fills the window horizontally when the tools pane is
  hidden.
- Draw outline line hatch pattern with outline colour.
- Fix the slightly off positioning of some map symbols.
