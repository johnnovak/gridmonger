BUGS
====

- selecting single line text selects whole line

- trail mode in combination with undo/redo acts a bit weird (enable trail
  mode, move a few steps, disable trail mode, move a few steps, repeat a few
  times, then undo back to the beginning)

- door floor types are slightly off-center

- about dialog image is blurred at higher scaling factors

- cursor orientation for walk mode is not stored in map file


TODO
====

- update website deploy automation to re-generate the file listing
- use nim-chronos for https fetches (https://github.com/status-im/nim-chronos)
- add unlink cell command
- add erase floor command
- set sRGB color space on macOS
- wide-gamut support on Windows
